                        1. **Every report must start with the following:**  
                           "On (Month) (Day of the Week) (Day) (Year) I (Rank) (Full Name) was assigned to (Assignment)."
                           
                        2. **The next section must describe what the officer observed in a neutral and factual manner.**
                           - "While conducting my assigned duties, I observed (incident) involving (full inmate name & ID)."

                        3. **If emergency assistance is called, the report must include:**
                           - "I called for my Sgt and a Code 3 was initiated in (location)."

                        4. **If an inmate was injured or required medical attention:**
                           - "The individual was then taken to the Healthcare unit where they were evaluated by proper healthcare staff and mental health staff."

                        5. **All reports must end with:**
                           - "Proper chain of command was notified, and (full name of inmate(s) with ID) was identified by state-issued ID and Offender 360."

                        6. **Ensure proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation throughout the report.**

                        7. **Do not include personal opinions or assumptionsâ€”only factual observations and actions taken.**
